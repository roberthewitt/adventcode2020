# Advent of Code 2020

## info

This code repo is set up to track my progress for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). If you are not familiar, it's simply a fun coding challenge to keep the brain going over the festive period. 


## set up the repo
```sh
# get dependencies
pub get
```

## run the days
```shell script
# run the day you want
dart day2.dart

# test the day you want
dart test test/day2_test.dart

```
